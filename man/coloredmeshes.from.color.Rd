  subject_id,
  color_data,
  hemi,

  metadata = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{subjects_dir}{string. The FreeSurfer SUBJECTS_DIR, i.e., a directory containing the data for all your subjects, each in a subdir named after the subject identifier.}

\item{subject_id}{string. The subject identifier.}

\item{color_data}{a hemilist containing vectors of hex color strings}

\item{hemi}{string, one of 'lh' or 'rh'. The hemisphere name. Used to construct the names of the label data files to be loaded.}

\item{surface}{character string or `fs.surface` instance. The display surface. E.g., "white", "pial", or "inflated". Defaults to "white".}

\item{metadata}{a named list, can contain whatever you want. Typical entries are: 'src_data' a hemilist containing the source data from which the 'color_data' was created, optional. If available, it is encoded into the coloredmesh and can be used later to plot a colorbar. 'makecmap_options': the options used to created the colormap from the data.}
