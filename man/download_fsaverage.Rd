\description{
Download some relevant files from the FreeSurfer v6 fsaverage subject. The files are subject to the FreeSurfer software license, see parameter 'accept_freesurfer_license' for details. This data is not required for the package to work. If you are working on a machine that has FreeSurfer installed, you already have this data anyways and do not need to download it. If not, it is very convenient to have it if you are using the fsaverage template subject to analyze your standard space data, as it is required for visualization of such data.
