\title{Voxel-based visualization of volume mask at surface RAS positions.}
\usage{
volvis.voxels(volume, render_every = 1, voxelcol = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{volume}{numeric 3d array, voxels which should not be plotted must have value `NA`. Take care not to plot too many.}

\item{render_every}{integer, how many to skip before rendering the next one (to improve performance and/or see deeper structures). Use higher values to see a less dense representation of your data that usually still allows you to see the general shape, but at lower computational burden. Set to 1 to render every (foreground) voxel.}

\item{voxelcol}{character string or a *voxel coloring*. A *voxel coloring* can be specified in three ways: 1) the string 'from_intensity' will compute colors based on the intensity values of the foreground voxels in the volume, applying normalization of the intensity values if needed. 2) an array of RGB color strings: will be used to retrieve the colors for all foreground vertices, at their CRS indices. 3) A vector with length identical to the number of foreground voxels in the volume: will be applied directly.  Obvisouly, you should not pass a color material parameter (see `...`) when using this.}

\item{...}{material properties, passed to \code{\link[rgl]{triangles3d}}. Example: \code{color = "#0000ff", lit=FALSE}.}
}
\description{
Plots a 3D box at every *foreground* voxel in the given volume. All voxels which do not have their intensity value set to `NA` are considered *foreground* voxels. The locations at which to plot the voxels is computed from the voxel CRS indices using the FreeSurfer \code{\link[fsbrain]{vox2ras_tkr}} matrix. This means that the position of the rendered data fits to the surface coordinates (in files like `surf/lh.white`), and that you can call this function while an active surface rendering window is open (e.g., from calling \code{\link[fsbrain]{vis.subject.morph.native}}), to superimpose the surface and volume data. **On coloring the voxels** (using *rgl materials*): Note that you can call this function several times for the active plot, and color the voxels differently by passing different material properties in each call. Alternatively, check the `voxelcol` parameter.
