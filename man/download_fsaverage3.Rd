\description{
Download some relevant files from the FreeSurfer v6 fsaverage3 subject. The files are subject to the FreeSurfer software license, see parameter 'accept_freesurfer_license' for details. This data is not required for the package to work. If you are working on a machine that has FreeSurfer installed, you already have this data anyways and do not need to download it.
}
\note{
The subject fsaverage3 is a downsampled (low mesh resolution) version of the standard fsaverage. If you never heard about fsaverage3, you do not need it. You will have to manually re-sample your data in FreeSurfer if you want to use it with fsaverage3.
