## About

The *fsbrain* R package provides a well-tested and consistent interface to neuroimaging data in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). It supports reading, writing, and visualizing various kinds of raw data and statistical results on brain surfaces and volumes. While the package provides a very convenient interface for working with data arranged in the standard [FreeSurfer](http://freesurfer.net/) directory structure (SUBJECTS_DIR), *fsbrain* is not limited to this layout or FreeSurfer file formats. You can load brain meshes, volumes, and data from a range of other neuroimaging software packages and visualize them.

The plots produced by *fsbrain* can be integrated into R notebooks or written to high-quality bitmap image files, ready for publication. The [rgl](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgl) renderer used by *fsbrain* provides fast, hardware-accelerated rendering based on the OpenGL standard.

## Installation


### Recommended: install the stable fsbrain version from CRAN

You can find the [fsbrain package on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fsbrain), so all you need to do is:

```r
install.packages("fsbrain");
```

In case something goes wrong, don't worry. Just install the missing [system dependencies](#system-dependencies) and retry.


### Risky: install the dev version of fsbrain with the latest features

This version is not guaranteed to be in a usable state, try at your own risk and run the tests before using it.

From an R session:

```r
install.packages(c("devtools", "knitr", "markdown", "rmarkdown", "testthat", "qpdf"));
devtools::install_github("dfsp-spirit/fsbrain", build_vignettes=TRUE);
```

### System dependencies

A *system dependency* is a **non-R** software that is needed for the installation of a package. System dependencies cannot be installed automatically using the R package system, so you need to install them manually or using the package manager of your operating system.

The *fsbrain* package itself does not have any system dependencies, however, it uses *rgl* for rendering. You can check the *SystemRequirements* section on the [rgl page at CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgl) for the full list of rgl dependencies or read on. To get GIFTI format support, you will also need `libxml2-dev`.

To install the system dependencies for *rgl* and *xml2*:

#### Linux System dependencies (or: building from source)

R packages are compiled from source by default under Linux, so you need some development libraries. Before installing *fsbrain*, run the following command in your system shell (not in R):

* for deb-based Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, ...):
```shell
sudo apt-get install libmagick++-dev libx11-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev libfreetype6-dev libxml2-dev libssh-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libgfortran4
```
* for rpm-based Linux distributions (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, ...):
```shell
sudo yum install ImageMagick-c++-devel libX11-devel mesa-libGLU-devel freetype-devel libxml2-devel
```

If you want to compile the package under any other operating system, you will need the libraries as well, of course.

#### MacOS System dependencies

Recent MacOS versions do not ship with an X11 environment. You will have to install the [xquartz X11 system](https://www.xquartz.org/) if you do not have it already. If you want to create GIF movies, make sure you have imagemagick installed (easiest via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install imagemagick@6`).


#### Windows Installation Hints

Under Windows 10, it seems that you will need to install these two packages manually via the `install.packages` command: `shiny` and `manipulateWidget`.


### Installation via Docker

There are Docker images for fsbrain available on Dockerhub, see the [fsbrain Dockerhub repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/dfspspirit/fsbrain).


## Documentation

The documentation can be accessed from within an R session after you have loaded the *fsbrain* package:

* There are two online R Markdown notebooks (like Jupyter Notebook in Python) that show various example plots in combination with the code used to produce them:
  * [basic fsbrain example notebook](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain/blob/develop/web/Rmd_web_examples/examples.html): Live visualization of subject data
  * [advanced fsbrain example notebook](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain/blob/develop/web/Rmd_web_examples/examples_adv.html): Plotting group data
  * [export API fsbrain example notebook](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain/blob/develop/web/Rmd_web_examples/examples_export.html): Exporting publication-ready plots
  
  
* Detailed vignettes with explanations and examples for the functions of the package is included, run `browseVignettes("fsbrain")` to see the vignettes. You can also open the vignette directly:
  * How to load and visualize surface-based neuroimaging data: `vignette("fsbrain")` or: [read online at CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fsbrain/vignettes/fsbrain.html)
  * How to load and visualize volume-based neuroimaging data: `vignette("fsbrain_vol")` or: [read online at CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fsbrain/vignettes/fsbrain_vol.html)
  * The fsbrain FAQ: `vignette("fsbrain_faq")` or: [read online at CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fsbrain/vignettes/fsbrain_faq.html)
  
  
* Help for a specific function can be accessed in the usual R manner: `?<function>`, where you replace `<function>` with a function name. Like this: `?group.morph.native`.
* Run `example(<function>)` to see a live demo that uses the function `<function>`. Like this: `example(group.morph.native)`.
* The [unit tests](./tests/testthat/) that come with this package are essentially a list of examples that illustrate how to use the functions.



## Unit tests and Continuous integration


This package comes with [lots of unit tests](./tests/testthat/). To run them, in a clean R session:

```r
library(devtools)
library(fsbrain)
devtools::check()
```

Continuous integration results:

## Visualization examples

The *fsbrain* package support visualizations of different data, and all data can be displayed in one or more views. The figure below shows some examples for surface-based data:

![Visoverview](./web/fsbrain_vis_overview.jpg?raw=true "Some visualization options from fsbrain")
**Fig.2**: *Example output for the fsbrain interactive visualization functions*.

* **Subfigure A** shows the visualization of raw morphometry data (cortical thickness) from native space on the white surface of a subject. The view shows the data in tiles from 8 different angles.
* **Subfigure B** illustrates arbitrary data (p-values in this case) visualized on the regions of the Desikan atlas, using the surface of the fsaverage (standard space template) subject from FreeSurfer. The view shows the data in tiles from 4 different angles.
* **Subfigure C** displays the regions of the Desikan atlas on the white surface of a subject. The colors were loaded from the respective annotation file. The view shows the data in tiles from 4 different angles.

*What* is displayed (morphometry data, atlas regions, arbitrary other data), on *which surface* it is displayed, and *how* it is displayed (a single interactive view, 4 tiles, 9 tiles) is independent and can be selected as needed in fsbrain.

Here is a second figure, showing the same data (the [mean curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_curvature) at each vertex) displayed on 3 different surfaces of a subject: **A** white surface, **B** pial surface, **C** inflated surface.
![Vissurfaces](./web/fsbrain_curvature_surfaces.jpg?raw=true "Curvature visualization on different surfaces, rendered with fsbrain")


The next figure illustrates some options to visualize your results with different backgrounds. **A** Clusters on the white fsaverage surface with sulc background. **B** Region-wise p-values with curv background, inflated fsaverage surface. **C** A background color layer displaying outlines of aparc atlas regions in the respective colors, inflated demo subject surface.

### Animations and videos

Want to see brains spin? [Check this out.](./web/fsbrain_movies.md) (WARNING: loads 8 MB webpage with animated gif).

### Volume visualization

Volume visualization is not the main goal of fsbrain, but standard lightbox views and simple 3D views are supported. Have a look at the vignettes or the documentation for the `volvis.lb` function. You can find some [example output here](./web/fsbrain_volume.md).

### Example Notebooks

To see a combination of example figures and the code used to produce them, you should have a look at the example notebooks: [getting started notebook](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain/blob/develop/web/Rmd_web_examples/examples.html) and [advanced examples notebook](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain/blob/develop/web/Rmd_web_examples/examples_adv.html).
